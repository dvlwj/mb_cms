# mb_cms
Hello, guys.
I know this repository's name is very weird, MB_CMS. WTF is that ? 
I know you all will saying something like this when seeing/reading this repository, so i want to tell you about this repository background.

I make this repository as my graduation project to accompany my graduation exam in my last semester in University (yes, im graduated). In my essay im writing about how a simple system ( a website in my case ) can improve some company marketing and the company where i got permission to did my research has Mega Baut as the name. Because of that, i make a abbreviation of the name and add content management system ( because this system is just a simple website with a CRUD system to manage and controlling item catalouge ) and its became <b>mb_cms</b>.

# why laravel ?
First, im a frontend developer who have a very basic skill in backend.
Second, I need a solid security system in login, database, etc. Because of this reason i choose a framework to build my system. And i decided to use Laravel. Why? because it was the most known PHP framework for me.

# why is the everything too simple ?
Well, im too focus on the essay rather than the system itself, its why the system itself is too simple in frontend and backend.

# Opensource ?
Yes, its was opensource, you can develope it as much as you can. But, you need to tell me if you want to develope it. <b>Because im happy to see and try yours</b>.

# Thanks
